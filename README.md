# JavaScript Jest Example

This is an example for writing a JavaScript function 
guided by tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
To run the test you'll need [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to be installed.  
To get started first clone this repository into a project folder of your choice.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/andrebauer/js-tdd-example-max.git your-project-name
```

Alternatively you can download the latest [ZIP-Archive](https://github.com/andrebauer/js-tdd-example-max/archive/master.zip).

Inside your repository run `npm install`

```sh
$ npm install
```

After everything is set up, you can run the tests with `npm test`. 

```sh
$ npm test
```
